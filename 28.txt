	Wopowrimo:
	Half an hour's quiet reflection each day
	Because a challenge is a gift, not a curse.

I'm not a poet; I'm an engineer. Not that the two need to be mutually
exclusive, of course; but either way, I don't consider myself even an
amateur poet.

However, I decided to do WoPoWriMo, because trying to do something I
don't know how to do is a learning experience to be enjoyed, not
something to be afraid of. I've found I can knock out reasonable
haiku; and I've had some fun doing it in git!
