	A river drops sand and stones where it slows down
	People are no different.


One thing that fascinates me is how fundamental patterns cut across
all aspects of life. The study of this is called "advanced mathematics".

One of them is that, whenever there is a combination of some
relatively active force and some other force that encourages things to
stay still, then in regions where the active force dominates, things
are swept away; yet in regions where the staying force dominates, they
get stuck again.

Sometimes the active force is the flowing of a river, while the
staying force is friction.

Sometimes the active force is human curiosity with novel things, while
the staying force is familiarity.

Sometimes the active force is a lively child, while the staying force
is things falling down the back of the bed.

In all these cases, the same basic pattern emerges, with the same
consequences. And the result is usually beautiful, in one way or
another.
