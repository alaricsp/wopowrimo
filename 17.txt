	I come home.
	A cat jumps into my lap. My daughter smiles. My wife strokes my hair.
	The stream burbles its way through the garden.


I don't like spending half of every week away from home.

When I'm in London, I sleep on friends' living room floors, and live
out of a bag. I can have nothing I cannot carry on my person.

I used to keep some spare clothes, stuff for showering, a shaver, some
sentimental trinkets, and my climbing gear (for I sometimes go
climbing with my friends) in the office, until one day I found it all
in a bag by my desk with a note on it asking me to take it away.
