	A tree stands by the river.
	Once, it was a tiny seed, cast to the winds
	Now, children play in its shade.

A bit of a change of style here. Rather than making a profound
statement that gets a free essay, just expressing something.

I could go on about the contrast between the youth of the tree and,
now it is old, the youth of the children playing beneath it, and how
the tree was vulnerable in the hands of the elements as a seed but now
it shades the children from the elements, and all that stuff, but that
might be like ruining a joke by explaining it.
