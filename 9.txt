	Young people out on the town:
	Burning with colour and life
	What kind of ash will they leave?


I've always looked on people going out "pubbing and clubbing" from the
peerpsective of an outsider. A few times I've been technically part of
such a group, but I've never really gotten into the spirit of it; it
goes against my nature to let my guard down and go unprepared into
those kinds of environments.

I'm not entirely sure what pleasure people find in being out late in
noisy, harshly lit, uncomfortable, expensive environments. But I know
this is my loss; many people are clearly happy to do it, and therefore
they derive pleasure from it in a way that escapes me.
