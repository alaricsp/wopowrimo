	Valentine's Day:
	Yet another festival of commerce,
	But we can enjoy it anyway.


Purveryors of flowers, cute objects, greeting cards, and Italian meals
for two are of course all too happy to encourage people to make use of
their services on Valentine's Day; indeed, the advertising at this
time of year, although mild in comparison to the commercialisation of
Christmas, downright suggests one should feel guilty of one does not
spend a lot of money on their loved ones.

But there's no reason to get upset about this. Who cares what other
people think about a date? Enjoying the atmosphere of group
celebration is free, and it's not healthy to feel guilty about not
going along with the masses.
