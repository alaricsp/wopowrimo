	Cat on my lap.
	Fierce hunter, sharp claws, lightning reflexes.
	Kitten-soft purring.


I love the dichotomy of a cat: they have this delightful cute
softness, with their purring and their little nuzzling noses - yet
they are no soft toy; they are finely-tuned night hunters.

What more can we aspire to, other than to combine ultimate power with
adorable cuteness?
