	The blacksmith:
	Once, the maker of most tools
	Now, just fancy railings


Ok, modern blacksmiths don't *just* make fancy railings. They also
make fancy hinges and pokers and all sorts of stuff.

But they're all *fancy* luxury items, elegantly made by the blacksmith
as artist. For sure, this requires much more skill than making
utilitarian tools, but somehow, it saddens me.

I want to learn blacksmithing - but in order to produce useful things,
exactly tailored to the task at hand, rather than being limited to
off-the-shelf products.
