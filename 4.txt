	London:
	Crowded with lonely people
	Each in their own city

I lived in London for many years, in a variety of places; and one
thing I found everywhere was that when people are all squeezed in
together, they try harder to ignore one another. I could be on busy
trains, or living in high rise buildings, but all the people around me
were so busy trying to ignore the crush of people around them, that
actually breaking through the barrier to start a conversation was
nearly impossible. If you try, they think you're trying to sell them
something.
