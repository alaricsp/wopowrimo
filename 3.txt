        Train carriage:
        A hundred empty seats
        And me.

Written sitting on a train from home into London. Although the train
is considered a much more environmentally friendly way to travel long
distances than driving, but I wonder if that still holds when I have
an entire carriage to myself.

I think it's eighty-something seats rather than an actual
hundred... but a hundred was More Poetic. So There.
