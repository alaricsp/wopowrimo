	It can't all be bad luck:
	Are these endless setbacks just chance,
	or fate training me to be invincible?

Unlikely things do seem to keep happening to me! Humans have a
tendency to attribute events to some unseen intelligent agent, which
is the fuel for superstition and conspiracy theories. But I manage to
make my way out of all the difficult situations I find myself in, by
hook or by crook; and so life's more mundane problems seem trivial by
comparison. So if there is a secret underground society meddling with
my life - perhaps they're just training me to be their next super
secret agent?
